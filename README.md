Anomaly Detection System
Description
This project focuses on developing an anomaly detection system to identify unusual patterns or outliers in data. Anomaly detection is crucial for various applications, including fraud detection, network security, fault detection, and monitoring system health.

Why
Detecting anomalies early can help prevent potential issues, improve system reliability, and enhance decision-making by identifying unusual behavior that may indicate fraud, system failures, or other critical events.

Tasks
Gather Data:

Collect datasets that contain normal and anomalous records for analysis. Example datasets can be found here (insert a link to your datasets).
Preprocess Data:

Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and noise.
Normalize or standardize data if necessary to improve model performance.
Feature Engineering:

Extract relevant features that help in detecting anomalies.
Create new features based on domain knowledge to enhance the model's accuracy.
Implement Anomaly Detection Techniques:

Choose appropriate anomaly detection algorithms such as:
Statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR)
Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Local Outlier Factor)
Deep learning approaches (e.g., Autoencoders, LSTM)
Evaluate Model Performance:

Use metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess the performance of the anomaly detection model.
Conduct cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalizability of the model.
Visualize Results:

Create visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, histograms) to illustrate detected anomalies and model performance.
Use visualization tools to help interpret the results effectively.
Deployment:

Integrate the anomaly detection model into a real-time monitoring system.
Set up alerts or dashboards to notify stakeholders of detected anomalies.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, keras (or any other libraries you choose to use)
